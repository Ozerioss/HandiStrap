# HandiStrap
Android App HandiStrap. 
This mobile app was created to help disabled people by sending them a notification whenever they were near an acessible spot like a restaurant, park, restrooms etc. 
It uses the database provided by opendata.paris.fr to give us the latitude and longitude of those spots along with a bried description.
The final project is a strap connected to the app which will vibrate when near the actual spot hence the name of the app.
It consists of comparing the latitude and longitude which is in our database ( that we converted into an excel file to easily access it ) with the coordinates provided by the phone.
If the coordinates provided by the phone matched those in the database, we'd get a notification and the strap would vibrate.
The app was designed to help make the life of disabled people a little bit easier by providing them the tools to also add in the location where they are (if it is accessible for disabled people) into the database.
