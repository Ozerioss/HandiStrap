# HandiStrap
Android App HandiStrap. 
This mobile app was created to help disabled people by sending them a notification whenever they were near an acessible spot like a restaurant, park, restrooms etc. 
It uses the database provided by opendata.paris.fr to give us the latitude and longitude of those spots. 
The final project was supposed to be a strap connected to the app which will vibrate when near the actual spot hence the name of the app.
It consisted of comparing the latitude and longitude which is in our database with the coordinates provided by the phone.
If the coordinates provided by the phone matched those in the database, we'd get a notification and ideally the strap would vibrate.
But time was not favorable to us which caused the function to not be implemented. The app was designed to help make the life of disabled people a little bit easier by providing them the tools to also add in the location where they are into the database.
